# LeKiwi_custom
Custom parts designed to use more common servos or wheels, using open source software ( FreeCad ) to create them.

## The Motor Mount 
   I had some existing WaveShare Seiak Servo ST3215 that were similar to the ones used in the Lekiwi project, but the WaveShare had an extra hump near the servo disc, and 2 of the tiney screw holes moved 3mm, so I created this model. It may be more universal than the original project version.

## The 12mm Hex Wheel Adapter
   I had some HiWonder 97mm Mecanum wheels I wanted to use, so this adapter connects my servo to the 12mm Hex.

## The 8mm Hex Wheel Adapter
   I have some 97mm Mecanum wheels with 8mm hex, but I have not designed an adapter for them yet. Let me know if you need it.
